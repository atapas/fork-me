Hello Mr. Tapas Adhikary, I wanted to express my heartfelt appreciation for your efforts in teaching beginners how to fork repositories and intiate PRs on GitHub. Your willingness to merge our random README files to showcase GitHub's functionality is incredibly valuable and inspiring.

Thank you for creating an inclusive learning environment and empowering those who want to get into tech like myself.

With gratitude, Ravichandran Gethushan.
