# Introduction

My name is Mike Shelton and my github account is
[vbsmbb](https://github.com/vbsmbb). I am a retired technologist who spent
forty years in technology in both the public and private sectors. I have
worked as a Systems Engineer, Systems Administrator, and Database
Administrator over the years. I've also worked with Unix, Linux, and Windows
servers and workstations. You could say that I was a technologist before anyone
knew about technologists.

I am currently training to be a front-end developer. I have taken courses
in HTML & CSS and JavaScript. I find it very inetresting, but I am not a
great designer. I have a better head for JavaScript development and most
backend development skills.

This is not the first Open Source project that I have been involved with,
I did create a pull request that was accepted and merged into the the master,
but I am working on increasing my skills and becoming more involved in other
Open Source projects.

I am also on twitter @vbsmbb.

I look forward to working with all of the contributors to this project at some
time in the future.
