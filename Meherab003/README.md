> The Tale of Fork and Pull
I clicked a fork; the skies were clear.
A repo clone, now mine to steer.
From open source, a dream was born.
To tweak, improve, and not be torn.
I cloned it down with git clone, Grace
Created a branch, a coding space.
With every line and clever fix,
I patched the bugs; I added tricks.
Then came the time; I pushed it high,
To GitHub, under my own sky.
But wait — I'm not the final judge.
So to the source, I would not nudge.
Instead, I made a pull request.
A humble plea: "I’ve done my best!"
"Review my code, and if it's fine,
Please merge it with your mainline."
The maintainers read with keen delight.
They left some notes and said, “Just right!”
They clicked merge; the work was blessed.
And now my code lives with the rest.
Moral of the tale? If you wish to contribute,
A fork and PR are your perfect route.
In open source, your voice can shine —
One branch, one push, one pull at a time.
